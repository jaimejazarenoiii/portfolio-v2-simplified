		Full stack engineer.<br>
		Curiosity was what I had that made me tried programming. I like to know what's the unknown, which I think is great trait as an engineer. <br>
		When it comes to product, I do love to work on things that will have a great impact to a lot of people. Something that might help with their everyday lives; a hero, as one might say <br>

	<p>In regards to my non-work related life, I'm a family man, who loves his wife and son. Melophile. Hooper. Into photography and art.</p>
